1-Instead of using StatusController for background job, i just created Service(ImdbStatusService) for that.
2-Added swager into the api , so it will be helpfull if some one want to use swagger instead of postman.
3-Added middleware for error handling & execution time tracking.

All the other changes are done as per requirement.
